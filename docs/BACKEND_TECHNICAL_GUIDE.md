## 🎯 The Big Picture

Imagine you're running a super advanced robot factory that makes LinkedIn posts about AI research papers. Here's what happens:

1. **Someone places an order** (sends a request): "Hey, make me a LinkedIn post about this AI paper!"
2. **Your factory starts working** (multi-agent system kicks in):
   - **Research Robot** 🤖 goes and finds everything about the paper
   - **Writer Robot** ✍️ creates an awesome LinkedIn post
   - **Fact-Checker Robot** 🔍 makes sure everything is accurate
   - **Style-Checker Robot** 💫 makes sure it looks good on LinkedIn
3. **Your customer gets updates** in real-time about what each robot is doing
4. **Final product is delivered** - a perfect LinkedIn post!

That's PostAssist in a nutshell. Now let's see how we built this robot factory!

## 🌟 What is FastAPI? (And Why It's Awesome)

Before diving into the code, let's understand what FastAPI is. Think of it like this:

**Traditional Python program:** You write code, run it, it does something, and stops.

**FastAPI program:** You write code that creates a "server" - a program that stays running forever, waiting for requests from the internet, processes them, and sends back responses.

```python
# Traditional Python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)  # Runs once, then stops
```

```python
# FastAPI style
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/add/{a}/{b}")
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int):
    return {"result": a + b}

# This stays running forever, waiting for requests like:
# GET http://localhost:8000/add/5/3
```

FastAPI is like having a super-smart receptionist for your Python functions - it:
- Takes requests from the internet
- Checks if the data is valid
- Calls your functions
- Sends back properly formatted responses
- Handles multiple requests at the same time (this is where "async" comes in!)

## ⚡ Understanding Async Programming

This is the trickiest concept, so let's use a real-world analogy:

### 🍕 The Pizza Restaurant Analogy

**Synchronous (regular) programming** is like a pizza restaurant with one chef:
1. Customer A orders → Chef makes pizza → Serves pizza → Customer B can order
2. Everyone waits in line

**Asynchronous programming** is like a pizza restaurant with one chef who's really smart:
1. Customer A orders → Chef starts dough, puts it in oven → While oven works, takes Customer B's order
2. Chef checks on Customer A's pizza, starts Customer B's pizza
3. Multiple orders cooking at once!

```python
# Synchronous - everything waits
def make_post():
    research_paper()    # Takes 30 seconds, everyone waits
    write_post()       # Takes 20 seconds, everyone waits
    verify_post()      # Takes 10 seconds, everyone waits
    return "Done!"     # Total: 60 seconds

# Asynchronous - things can happen in parallel
async def make_post():
    research_task = asyncio.create_task(research_paper())    # Start this
    write_task = asyncio.create_task(write_post())          # Start this too
    verify_task = asyncio.create_task(verify_post())        # And this!
    
    await research_task    # Wait for research to finish
    await write_task       # Wait for writing to finish  
    await verify_task      # Wait for verification to finish
    return "Done!"         # Total: 30 seconds (they ran in parallel!)
```

In our PostAssist backend:
- Multiple people can request LinkedIn posts at the same time
- While one AI agent is researching, another can be writing
- The server can handle many requests without getting stuck

## 🏗️ The Application Structure

Our backend is organized like a well-structured house:

```
api/
├── main.py              # 🏠 The main house (FastAPI app)
├── config.py            # ⚙️ Settings and configuration
├── models/              # 📋 Data structure blueprints
│   ├── requests.py      # What users send us
│   ├── responses.py     # What we send back
│   └── state.py         # How we track progress
├── agents/              # 🤖 The AI workers
│   ├── meta_supervisor.py   # 👑 The boss AI
│   ├── content_team.py      # ✍️ Research & Writing team
│   ├── verification_team.py # 🔍 Quality control team
│   └── helpers.py           # 🔧 Shared utilities
└── tools/               # 🛠️ AI's superpowers
    ├── linkedin_tools.py    # LinkedIn-specific tools
    └── search_tools.py      # Internet search tools
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Management

Let's start with `api/config.py` - this is like the control panel for our entire application:

```python
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    # API Configuration
    app_name: str = "PostAssist"
    app_version: str = "1.0.0"
    host: str = "0.0.0.0"
    port: int = 8000
    
    # AI Keys - these are like passwords to use AI services
    openai_api_key: str = ""
    tavily_api_key: str = ""
    
    # Redis - our memory bank for storing tasks
    redis_url: str = "redis://localhost:6379"
    redis_task_ttl: int = 7200  # 2 hours
    
    # How many things can happen at once
    max_concurrent_generations: int = 3
    max_concurrent_verifications: int = 5
```

**What's happening here?**
- `BaseSettings` is like a smart dictionary that can read settings from environment variables
- Think of environment variables like secret notes you leave for your program
- Instead of hardcoding passwords in your code (bad!), you store them separately
- When the program starts, it reads these settings and knows how to behave

**Cool trick:** You can create a `.env` file:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_secret_key_here
TAVILY_API_KEY=another_secret_key
```

And Pydantic automatically loads them! No more passwords in your code! 🔐

---

## 📋 Data Models - The Blueprint

In `api/models/`, we define the "shape" of our data using Pydantic models. Think of these like blueprints for building houses - they define exactly what each piece of data should look like.

### Request Models (`requests.py`)

```python
class PostGenerationRequest(BaseModel):
    paper_title: str = Field(
        description="Title of the ML paper",
        min_length=5,
        max_length=500
    )
    target_audience: str = "professional" 
    include_technical_details: bool = True
    max_hashtags: int = Field(default=10, ge=1, le=20)
```

**What's happening:**
- `Field()` adds validation rules - like "this must be between 5-500 characters"
- `ge=1, le=20` means "greater or equal to 1, less or equal to 20"
- If someone sends invalid data, Pydantic automatically rejects it and explains why!

### Response Models (`responses.py`)

```python
class PostStatusResponse(BaseModel):
    task_id: str
    status: TaskStatus  # This is an enum: PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, FAILED
    progress: float = Field(ge=0.0, le=1.0)  # Progress from 0% to 100%
    teams: List[TeamProgress] = []
```

**Why this is awesome:**
- FastAPI automatically converts these to JSON
- Your frontend knows exactly what format to expect
- If you change the model, your API documentation updates automatically!

### State Models (`state.py`)

These are special models for our AI agents to track their progress:

```python
class LinkedInMetaState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[List[BaseMessage], operator.add]
    next: str
    task_id: Optional[str]
    progress: float
    research_complete: bool
    content_complete: bool
    verification_complete: bool
```

**The magic of `operator.add`:**
- When multiple agents contribute messages, they get automatically combined
- `Annotated[List[BaseMessage], operator.add]` means "this is a list that grows when agents add to it"

---

## 🤖 The Multi-Agent AI System

This is where things get REALLY cool! Instead of one big AI doing everything, we have a team of specialized AI agents working together.

### The Team Structure

```
Meta-Supervisor (The Boss)
├── Content Team
│   ├── PaperResearcher (Finds info about papers)
│   └── LinkedInCreator (Writes awesome posts)
└── Verification Team
    ├── TechVerifier (Checks facts)
    └── StyleChecker (Makes it LinkedIn-perfect)
```

### Meta-Supervisor (`meta_supervisor.py`)

The meta-supervisor is like a project manager who coordinates different teams:

```python
def create_linkedin_meta_graph():
    llm = get_llm()
    
    # Create the boss AI
    linkedin_meta_supervisor = create_team_supervisor(
        llm,
        ("You are a meta-supervisor managing LinkedIn post generation. "
         "First direct the Content team to research and create a post. "
         "Then send it to the Verification team to check quality."),
        ["Content team", "Verification team"]
    )
    
    # Create the workflow graph
    linkedin_meta_graph = StateGraph(LinkedInMetaState)
    linkedin_meta_graph.add_node("Content team", content_chain)
    linkedin_meta_graph.add_node("Verification team", verification_chain)
    linkedin_meta_graph.add_node("meta_supervisor", linkedin_meta_supervisor)
```

**What's a StateGraph?**
- Think of it like a flowchart that can execute itself
- Each "node" is a step in the process
- "Edges" are the arrows between steps
- The AI decides which path to take based on the current situation

### Content Team (`content_team.py`)

```python
def create_content_team_graph():
    # Create Paper Researcher Agent
    paper_researcher_agent = create_agent(
        llm,
        [research_ml_paper, tavily_tool],  # These are its superpowers
        ("You are an expert AI researcher who specializes in understanding "
         "machine learning papers...")
    )
    
    # Create LinkedIn Creator Agent
    linkedin_creator_agent = create_agent(
        llm,
        [create_linkedin_post],
        ("You are a social media expert who creates engaging LinkedIn posts...")
    )
```

**How agents work:**
1. Each agent gets a specialized role (like job descriptions)
2. Each agent gets specific tools they can use
3. They work together, passing information between them
4. A supervisor coordinates their work

### The Helper Functions (`helpers.py`)

```python
def create_agent(llm: ChatOpenAI, tools: list, system_prompt: str) -> AgentExecutor:
    system_prompt += (
        "\nWork autonomously according to your specialty. "
        "Do not ask for clarification. "
        "You are chosen for a reason!"
    )
    
    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
        ("system", system_prompt),
        MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="messages"),
        MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="agent_scratchpad"),
    ])
    
    agent = create_openai_functions_agent(llm, tools, prompt)
    return AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools)
```

**What's happening:**
- `system_prompt` is like giving the AI its personality and job description
- `MessagesPlaceholder` is where conversation history goes
- `agent_scratchpad` is the AI's "thinking space"
- `AgentExecutor` wraps everything together and handles the tool-calling logic

---

## 🛠️ Tools - The AI's Superpowers

Tools are functions that AI agents can call to interact with the real world. Think of them as the AI's hands and eyes.

### Search Tools (`search_tools.py`)

```python
@tool
def research_ml_paper(
    paper_title: Annotated[str, "Title of the ML paper to research"],
    focus_areas: Annotated[Optional[List[str]], "Specific aspects to focus on"] = None
) -> Annotated[str, "Research findings about the ML paper"]:
    """Research a machine learning paper using web search."""
    
    # Build smart search query
    search_query = f"machine learning paper {paper_title} arxiv research"
    
    # Use Tavily (our search engine) to find information
    search_results = tavily_tool.invoke(search_query)
    
    # Search for specific aspects
    enhanced_results = []
    for area in focus_areas:
        area_query = f"{paper_title} {area} machine learning"
        area_results = tavily_tool.invoke(area_query)
        enhanced_results.append(f"--- {area.upper()} ---\n{area_results}")
    
    return f"MAIN FINDINGS:\n{search_results}\n\nFOCUSED AREAS:\n{enhanced_results}"
```

**The `@tool` decorator magic:**
- This turns a regular Python function into something AI agents can use
- The type annotations tell the AI what each parameter is for
- The AI can read the docstring to understand what the tool does
- When the AI needs to research a paper, it can call this function!

### LinkedIn Tools (`linkedin_tools.py`)

```python
@tool
def create_linkedin_post(
    content: Annotated[str, "The main content for the LinkedIn post"],
    paper_title: Annotated[str, "Title of the ML paper"],
    key_insights: Annotated[List[str], "List of key insights"],
    tone: Annotated[str, "Tone of the post"] = "professional"
) -> Annotated[str, "Generated LinkedIn post"]:
    """Create a LinkedIn post about a machine learning paper."""
    
    # Choose emoji based on tone
    emoji_map = {"professional": "🚀", "academic": "📚", "casual": "💡"}
    opening_emoji = emoji_map.get(tone, "🚀")
    
    # Create engaging opening
    opening = f"{opening_emoji} Transforming the Future of AI: {paper_title}"
    
    # Format the content
    post = f"{opening}\n\n{content}\n\n"
    
    # Add insights
    if key_insights:
        post += "💡 Key Takeaways:\n"
        for i, insight in enumerate(key_insights[:5], 1):
            post += f"\n{i}. {insight}"
    
    # Add engagement question
    post += "\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this research?\n\n"
    
    # Add hashtags
    hashtags = generate_linkedin_hashtags(paper_title, key_insights)
    post += " ".join(hashtags)
    
    return post
```

**What makes this special:**
- It's not just generating text - it's following LinkedIn best practices
- It adds emojis, formatting, engagement questions, and hashtags
- The AI agent can call this to create professionally formatted posts

### Verification Tools

```python
@tool
def verify_technical_accuracy(
    post_content: Annotated[str, "LinkedIn post to verify"],
    paper_reference: Annotated[str, "Reference info about the paper"]
) -> Annotated[str, "Technical accuracy assessment"]:
    """Verify the technical accuracy of claims in the post."""
    
    accuracy_issues = []
    
    # Check for overstated claims
    overstated_patterns = [r"revolutionary", r"breakthrough", r"perfect"]
    for pattern in overstated_patterns:
        if re.search(pattern, post_content, re.IGNORECASE):
            accuracy_issues.append(f"Overstated claim: '{pattern}'")
    
    # Calculate score
    accuracy_score = max(0.0, 1.0 - (len(accuracy_issues) * 0.2))
    
    return f"""
TECHNICAL VERIFICATION REPORT:
Score: {accuracy_score:.2f}/1.0
Issues: {accuracy_issues}
Status: {'APPROVED' if accuracy_score >= 0.7 else 'NEEDS REVISION'}
"""
```

**The verification process:**
- Uses regex patterns to detect potentially problematic language
- Calculates scores based on issues found
- Returns structured reports the AI can understand

---

## 🏠 The Main Application Logic

Now let's dive into `main.py` - the heart of our application where everything comes together!

### Application Setup

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, BackgroundTasks
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
import redis.asyncio as redis

# Create the FastAPI app
app = FastAPI(
    title=settings.app_name,
    version=settings.app_version,
    description="AI-powered LinkedIn post generation",
    docs_url="/docs",  # Automatic API documentation!
    redoc_url="/redoc"
)

# Add CORS middleware - lets websites talk to our API
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

**What's CORS?**
- Browsers have security rules about which websites can talk to which APIs
- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) settings tell browsers "it's okay for websites to use our API"
- In production, you'd be more specific about which origins are allowed

### Redis - Our Memory Bank

```python
redis_client: Optional[redis.Redis] = None
task_storage: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]] = {}  # Backup memory

async def get_redis_client():
    global redis_client
    if redis_client is None:
        try:
            redis_client = redis.from_url(settings.redis_url)
            await redis_client.ping()  # Test if it's working
        except Exception:
            redis_client = None  # Fall back to in-memory storage
    return redis_client
```

**Why Redis?**
- Redis is like a super-fast database that lives in memory
- We use it to store task progress so we can show real-time updates
- If Redis isn't available, we fall back to storing in Python dictionaries
- This is called "graceful degradation" - the app still works even if Redis fails!

### Task Management Functions

```python
async def store_task(task_id: str, task_data: Dict[str, Any]):
    """Store task data in Redis or fallback storage."""
    client = await get_redis_client()
    if client:
        try:
            # Use proper JSON serialization
            serialized_data = json.dumps(task_data, default=datetime_json_encoder)
            await client.setex(f"task:{task_id}", settings.redis_task_ttl, serialized_data)
        except Exception:
            task_storage[task_id] = task_data  # Fallback
    else:
        task_storage[task_id] = task_data
```

**The datetime problem:**
- JSON doesn't understand Python datetime objects
- `datetime_json_encoder` converts datetime to ISO strings
- `setex` stores data with an expiration time (TTL = Time To Live)

### Progress Tracking - The Really Cool Part!

```python
async def update_agent_status(task_id: str, agent_name: str, status: AgentStatus, 
                            current_activity: str = None, progress: float = None):
    """Update individual agent status within a task."""
    task_data = await get_task(task_id) or {}
    
    # Determine which team this agent belongs to
    team_mapping = {
        "PaperResearcher": "Content team",
        "LinkedInCreator": "Content team", 
        "TechVerifier": "Verification team",
        "StyleChecker": "Verification team"
    }
    
    team_name = team_mapping.get(agent_name, "Unknown team")
    
    # Update agent information
    agent_data = {
        "agent_name": agent_name,
        "status": status.value,
        "current_activity": current_activity,
        "progress": progress or 0.0,
        "last_update": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
    }
    
    task_data["teams"][team_name]["agents"][agent_name] = agent_data
    
    # Update team status based on agent statuses
    team_agents = task_data["teams"][team_name]["agents"]
    if all(agent["status"] == "completed" for agent in team_agents.values()):
        task_data["teams"][team_name]["status"] = "completed"
        task_data["teams"][team_name]["progress"] = 1.0
    
    await store_task(task_id, task_data)
```

**This is where the magic happens:**
- Every time an AI agent does something, we update its status
- We track which team each agent belongs to
- We calculate team progress based on individual agent progress
- Users can see real-time updates of exactly what's happening!

### Concurrency Control

```python
generation_semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(settings.max_concurrent_generations)
verification_semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(settings.max_concurrent_verifications)

async def run_post_generation_task(task_id: str, request: PostGenerationRequest):
    async with generation_semaphore:  # Only allow N concurrent generations
        try:
            # Start the AI workflow...
```

**What's a Semaphore?**
- Imagine a parking lot with only 3 spaces
- A semaphore is like the parking lot attendant
- When all spaces are full, new cars have to wait
- When a car leaves, the next car can enter
- This prevents our server from getting overwhelmed!

---

## 🌐 API Endpoints - The Front Door

### Health Check Endpoint

```python
@app.get("/", response_model=HealthCheckResponse)
async def root():
    """Root endpoint with basic health check."""
    return HealthCheckResponse(
        status="healthy",
        version=settings.app_version,
        services={
            "openai": "connected" if settings.openai_api_key else "not_configured",
            "tavily": "connected" if settings.tavily_api_key else "not_configured", 
            "redis": "connected" if await get_redis_client() else "not_available"
        }
    )
```

**Why health checks matter:**
- When you deploy to production, monitoring systems ping this endpoint
- If it returns an error, they know something's wrong
- It's like taking your app's pulse!

### The Main Event - Post Generation

```python
@app.post("/generate-post", response_model=PostGenerationResponse)
async def generate_linkedin_post(
    request: PostGenerationRequest,
    background_tasks: BackgroundTasks
):
    """Generate a LinkedIn post about an ML paper."""
    task_id = str(uuid.uuid4())  # Create unique ID
    
    # Store initial task data
    task_data = {
        "task_id": task_id,
        "status": TaskStatus.PENDING,
        "request_data": request.dict(),
        "created_at": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
        "progress": 0.0,
        "current_step": "queued"
    }
    
    await store_task(task_id, task_data)
    
    # Start background task
    background_tasks.add_task(run_post_generation_task, task_id, request)
    
    return PostGenerationResponse(
        task_id=task_id,
        status=TaskStatus.PENDING,
        message="LinkedIn post generation started successfully"
    )
```

**Background Tasks Magic:**
- When someone requests a post, we don't make them wait
- We immediately return a task ID and start the work in the background
- They can check progress using the task ID
- This is called "asynchronous processing"

### Status Checking

```python
@app.get("/status/{task_id}", response_model=PostStatusResponse)
async def get_post_status(task_id: str):
    """Get detailed status of a task."""
    task_data = await get_task(task_id)
    
    if not task_data:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND,
            detail=f"Task {task_id} not found"
        )
    
    # Convert stored data back to response models
    teams = []
    for team_name, team_info in task_data.get("teams", {}).items():
        # Convert agents to AgentFeedback models
        agents = []
        for agent_name, agent_info in team_info.get("agents", {}).items():
            agent_feedback = AgentFeedback(**agent_info)
            agents.append(agent_feedback)
        
        team_progress = TeamProgress(
            team_name=team_name,
            status=team_info.get("status"),
            progress=team_info.get("progress", 0.0),
            agents=agents
        )
        teams.append(team_progress)
    
    return PostStatusResponse(
        task_id=task_id,
        status=task_data.get("status"),
        progress=task_data.get("progress", 0.0),
        teams=teams
    )
```

**Data transformation:**
- We store data as simple dictionaries in Redis
- When returning to users, we convert back to proper Pydantic models
- This ensures type safety and validation

### The Background Task Function

```python
async def run_post_generation_task(task_id: str, request: PostGenerationRequest):
    """Background task to generate LinkedIn post using streaming approach."""
    async with generation_semaphore:
        try:
            await update_task_status(task_id, TaskStatus.IN_PROGRESS, 0.1, "starting")
            
            # Initialize all agents
            await update_agent_status(task_id, "PaperResearcher", AgentStatus.IDLE)
            await update_agent_status(task_id, "LinkedInCreator", AgentStatus.IDLE)
            
            # Import and run the AI workflow
            from api.agents.meta_supervisor import stream_linkedin_post_generation
            
            # Stream the generation process with real-time updates
            async def process_stream_step(step, task_id):
                # Update agent statuses based on current workflow step
                for node_name, node_result in step.items():
                    if node_name == "PaperResearcher":
                        await update_agent_status(
                            task_id, "PaperResearcher", 
                            AgentStatus.WORKING, "Researching paper", 0.5
                        )
                    elif node_name == "LinkedInCreator":
                        await update_agent_status(
                            task_id, "LinkedInCreator",
                            AgentStatus.WORKING, "Creating post", 0.8
                        )
            
            # Run the AI workflow with status updates
            for step in stream_linkedin_post_generation(
                paper_title=request.paper_title,
                task_id=task_id,
                status_callback=process_stream_step
            ):
                await process_stream_step(step, task_id)
            
            # Extract final result and mark as complete
            final_post_content = extract_linkedin_post_from_results(results)
            linkedin_post = LinkedInPost(
                content=final_post_content,
                word_count=len(final_post_content.split()),
                character_count=len(final_post_content)
            )
            
            await update_task_status(
                task_id, TaskStatus.COMPLETED, 1.0, "completed",
                result=linkedin_post.dict()
            )
            
        except Exception as e:
            await update_task_status(
                task_id, TaskStatus.FAILED, 1.0, "failed", 
                error=str(e)
            )
```

**The streaming magic:**
- Instead of waiting for everything to finish, we get updates as each step completes
- Each time an AI agent does something, we update the database
- Users see real-time progress updates!

## 🚨 Error Handling

Good applications handle errors gracefully. Here's how we do it:

```python
@app.exception_handler(HTTPException)
async def http_exception_handler(request, exc):
    """Handle HTTP exceptions."""
    error_response = ErrorResponse(
        error="http_error",
        message=exc.detail,
        details={"status_code": exc.status_code}
    )
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=exc.status_code,
        content=json.loads(error_response.json())
    )

@app.exception_handler(Exception)
async def general_exception_handler(request, exc):
    """Handle general exceptions."""
    error_response = ErrorResponse(
        error="internal_error",
        message="An unexpected error occurred",
        details={"exception": str(exc)}
    )
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=500,
        content=json.loads(error_response.json())
    )
```

**Why this matters:**
- Users get consistent, helpful error messages
- We don't leak sensitive information in error messages
- All errors follow the same format

### Timeout Handling

```python
try:
    verification_task = asyncio.create_task(_run_verification(request))
    verification_report = await asyncio.wait_for(
        verification_task, 
        timeout=settings.verification_timeout
    )
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=408,
        detail=f"Verification timed out after {settings.verification_timeout} seconds"
    )
```

**Preventing hangs:**
- If an AI request takes too long, we cancel it
- Users get a clear timeout message instead of waiting forever
- The server doesn't get stuck on slow requests

## 🧩 Putting It All Together

Let's trace through what happens when someone requests a LinkedIn post:

### Step 1: Request Arrives
```
POST /generate-post
{
  "paper_title": "Attention Is All You Need",
  "target_audience": "professional",
  "include_technical_details": true
}
```

### Step 2: FastAPI Processing
1. FastAPI receives the request
2. Pydantic validates the data against `PostGenerationRequest`
3. If valid, creates a unique task ID
4. Stores initial task data in Redis
5. Starts background task
6. Immediately returns task ID to user

### Step 3: Background AI Workflow
1. **Meta-supervisor** starts and decides to call "Content team"
2. **Content team supervisor** decides to call "PaperResearcher"
3. **PaperResearcher** uses `research_ml_paper` tool to search for information
4. **Content team supervisor** gets research results, decides to call "LinkedInCreator"
5. **LinkedInCreator** uses `create_linkedin_post` tool to write the post
6. **Meta-supervisor** gets the post, decides to call "Verification team"
7. **Verification team supervisor** calls "TechVerifier" and "StyleChecker"
8. **TechVerifier** uses `verify_technical_accuracy` to check facts
9. **StyleChecker** uses `check_linkedin_style` to check formatting
10. **Meta-supervisor** gets verification results and finishes

### Step 4: Real-time Updates
Throughout the process:
- Each agent update triggers `update_agent_status()`
- Task progress is stored in Redis
- Frontend can poll `/status/{task_id}` for updates
- Users see exactly which agent is doing what!

### Step 5: Final Result
- Complete LinkedIn post is extracted from AI messages
- Markdown formatting is cleaned up
- Final result is stored in Redis
- Task status changes to "COMPLETED"
